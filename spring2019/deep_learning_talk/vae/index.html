<h1 id="what-is-morphing-faces">What is Morphing Faces?</h1>

<p>Morphing Faces is an interactive Python demo allowing to generate images of
faces using a trained variational autoencoder and is a display of the capacity
of this type of model to capture high-level, abstract concepts.</p>

<p>The program maps a point in 400-dimensional space to an image and displays it on
screen. The point’s position is initialized at random, and its coordinates can
be varied two dimensions at a time by hovering the mouse over the image, which
produces smooth and plausible transitions between different lighting conditions,
physical features and facial configurations.</p>

<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>

<p>Installation is as simple as downloading the code uncompressing it wherever you
want. In addition to Python, Morphing Faces depends on the following Python
packages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.numpy.org/">numpy</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="running-the-demo">Running the demo</h2>

<p>In the <code class="highlighter-rouge">morphing_faces</code> directory, type</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python visualize.py
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You should see a matplotlib figure appearing. Now, hover the mouse over the
picture and the face should transform.</p>

<p>The mouse’s relative position in the image is tied to the coordinates of two of
the 400 dimensions: bottom-left corresponds to (-1, -1) and top-right
corresponds to (1, 1).</p>

<p>What about other dimensions? 400 is quite a large number, and most of them don’t
do much (this a consequence of the training procedure), but the 29 most
interesting dimensions are available to try. Simply type <code class="highlighter-rouge">d D1 D2</code> in the
command line interface, where <code class="highlighter-rouge">D1</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">D2</code> are two numbers between 0 and 28, in
order to select dimensions <code class="highlighter-rouge">D1</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">D2</code> to experiment with.</p>

<p>Maybe by now you found a way to create a funny facial expression and you would
like to keep it that way while you play with other dimensions. In that case,
click on the image to freeze it, change the selected dimensions and click the
image again to unfreeze it. The coordinates in the two previous dimensions will
be kept frozen, while you can interact with the newly selected dimensions.</p>

<p>If you’re bored with the current face and would like to see something else, type
<code class="highlighter-rouge">r</code> in the command line interface to pick another face at random. Behind the
scenes, a new point in the 400-dimensional space was chosen, and you can
move around it the usual way.</p>

<p>Finally, when you’ve had enough, simply type <code class="highlighter-rouge">q</code> in the command line interface
to quit.</p>

<h1 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h1>

<p>This section supposes a background in probabilities and recapitulates basic
concepts of probabilistic graphical models before introducing variational
autoencoders. For a (much) more thorough treatment of probabilistic graphical
models, see the excellent
<a href="http://pgm.stanford.edu/">Probabilistic Graphical Models - Principles and Techniques</a>
textbook written by Daphne Koller and Nir Friedman.</p>

<h2 id="probabilistic-graphical-models-and-bayesian-networks">Probabilistic graphical models and Bayesian networks</h2>

<p><em>For the sake of simplicity, we will assume that all variables introduced in
this section are discrete. Note that everything also applies for continuous
variables if sums are replaced by integrals where appropriate.</em></p>

<p>A probabilistic graphical model is a way to encode a distribution over random
variables as a graph, which can potentially yield a very compact representation
compared to regular probability tables. It does so by encoding dependences
between variables as edges between nodes.</p>

<p>Bayesian networks are a category of probabilistic graphical models whose
graphical representations are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The probability
distributions they encode are of the form</p>

<p>\[
    P(X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_n) = \prod_{i=1}^n P(X_i \mid \mathcal{Pa}(X_i))
\]</p>

<p>where \( \mathcal{Pa}(X_i) \) is the set of \( X_i \)’s parents in the
graph.</p>

<p>This concept is better illustrated by an example:</p>

<p><img src="/images/bayesian_network_example.png" alt="An example Bayesian network" /></p>

<p>Here, \( A\) has no parents, \( B \)’s parent is \( A\), \( C \)’s
parent is \( A\) and \( D \)’s parents are \( A \) and \( B \). The
probability distribution encoded by this graph is therefore</p>

<p>\[
    P(A, B, C, D) = P(A) P(B \mid A) P(C \mid A) P(D \mid A, B)
\]</p>

<h2 id="learning-bayesian-networks-and-the-inference-problem">Learning bayesian networks, and the inference problem</h2>

<p>Bayesian networks are interesting by themselves, but what’s even more
interesting is that they can be used to learn something about the distribution
of the random variables they model. Suppose you are given a set of observations
\( \mathcal{D} \), and suppose that the conditional distributions required by
your bayesian network are parametrized by some set of parameters
\( \theta \). The act of learning the distribution which generated the
observations could be described as follows: a parametrization of the model that
approaches the true distribution is a parametrization under which observations
in \( \mathcal{D} \) have a high probability, or alternatively, a high
log-probability (because the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function).
More formally, we are searching \( \theta^* \) such that</p>

<p>\[
    \theta^* = \arg\max_\theta \log P(X_1, \cdots, X_n)
              = \arg\max_\theta \sum_{i=1}^n
                \log P(X_i \mid \mathcal{Pa}(X_i))
\]</p>

<p>This parameter search can be done by various ways, for instance by gradient
descent.</p>

<p>This problem is straightforward if all variables are observed. Unfortunately,
this is not always the case. Suppose that in the example presented earlier only
\( C \) and \( D \) are observed, and the value of \( A \) and \( B \)
is always unknown (we would say that the former are <em>visible</em> or <em>observed</em>
variables, while the latter are <em>hidden</em> or <em>latent</em> variables). In that case,
all we’re really interested in is to maximize the likelihood of \( C \) and
\( D \) under the model, i.e. maximize</p>

<p>\[
    P(C, D) = \sum_{A}\sum_{B} P(A, B, C, D)
\]</p>

<p>Now things get hairy. What if \( A \) and \( B \) can take a great number of
values? What if, instead of the toy example presented above, the bayesian
network contains thousands of nodes, only a dozen of which are observed?
The summation quickly becomes <em>untractable</em>, and this does not bode well: how
can you maximize a quantity you cannot even evaluate?</p>

<p>One way out of this, which is oftentimes used in practice, is a technique known
as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation-maximization_algorithm">expectation-maximization</a>.
Unfortunately, it assumes that the conditional distribution of the hidden variables given the
observed ones is easy to compute, and this is not always the case.
What can we do, then?</p>

<h2 id="variational-autoencoders">Variational autoencoders</h2>

<p>Instead of seeking to maximize the likelihood, we could maximize a <em>lower bound</em>
of the likelihood: if the lower bound increases to a given level, we’re
guaranteed the likelihood is <em>at least</em> as high.</p>

<p>If your hidden variables are continuous, you can use one such lower bound,
introduced by <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114">(Kingma and Welling, 2014)</a>
and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4082">(Rezende <em>et al.</em>, 2014)</a>: <strong>variational
autoencoders (VAEs)</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="formal-setup">Formal setup</h3>

<p>Let \( \mathbf{x} \) be a random vector of \( D \) observed variables,
which are either discrete or continuous. Let \( \mathbf{z} \) be a random
vector of \( N \) latent variables, which are <strong>continuous</strong>. Let the
relationships between \( \mathbf{x} \) and \( \mathbf{z} \) be described
by the figure below:</p>

<p><img src="/images/vae_generative_network_figure.png" alt="The DAG learned by a VAE" /></p>

<p>The probability distribution encoded by this DAG has the form</p>

<p>\[
    p_\theta(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z})
    = p_\theta(\mathbf{z}) p_\theta(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathbf{z})
\]</p>

<p>where the \( \theta \) subscript indicates that \( p \) is parametrized by
\( \theta \).</p>

<p>Furthermore, let \( q_\phi(\mathbf{z} \mid \mathbf{x}) \) be a
<em>recognition model</em> whose goal is to approximate the true and intractable
posterior distribution \( p_\theta(\mathbf{z} \mid \mathbf{x}) \).</p>

<h3 id="the-vae-criterion">The VAE criterion</h3>

<p>In such a setting, the following expression is a lower-bound on the
log-likelihood of \( \mathbf{x} \):</p>

<p>\[
    \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x}) =
    - D_{KL}(q_\phi(\mathbf{z} \mid \mathbf{x}) \mid\mid
              p_\theta(\mathbf{z}))
    + \mathrm{E}_{q_\phi(\mathbf{z} \mid \mathbf{x})}
      [\log p_\theta(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathbf{z})]
\]</p>

<p>For a complete and very well-written derivation, see
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114">(Kingma and Welling, 2014)</a>.</p>

<p>We note that the expression contains two terms. The first term, which can
sometimes be integrated analytically, encourages
\( q_\phi(\mathbf{z} \mid \mathbf{x}) \) to be close to
\( p_\theta(\mathbf{z}) \). The second term, which needs to be approximated
by sampling from \( q_\phi(\mathbf{z} \mid \mathbf{x}) \), can be viewed
as a form of reconstruction cost.</p>

<p>Without the first term, this model is simply an autoencoder. It can learn any 
perfectly invertible representation, including the identity, and nothing
encourages it to learn a representation which is compatible with the prior
distribution \(p_\theta(\mathbf{z}) \). The first term ensures that while
training, the autoencoder learns a decoder that, at generation time, will
be able to invert samples from the prior distribution such that they come from
the right distribution, i.e. they look just like the training data.</p>

<h3 id="the-reparametrization-trick">The reparametrization trick</h3>

<p>The most <strong>crucial</strong> detail about VAEs is called the <strong>reparametrization trick</strong>
and deals with gradient propagation: since the reconstruction term is estimated
by sampling, how can we propagate the gradient signal through the sampling
process and through \( q_\phi(\mathbf{z} \mid \mathbf{x}) \)?</p>

<p>We do so by making \( \mathbf{z} \) be a deterministic function of
\( \phi \) and some noise \( \mathbf{\epsilon} \):</p>

<p>\[
    \mathbf{z} = f(\phi, \mathbf{\epsilon})
\]</p>

<p>such that \( \mathbf{z} \) has the right distribution. For instance, sampling
from an isotropic normal distribution can be done like so:</p>

<p>\[
    \mathbf{z} = \mu + \sigma \mathbf{\epsilon}
\]</p>

<p>This is what allows VAEs to be trained properly: without the reparametrization
trick, there is no efficient way of adapting
\( q_\phi(\mathbf{z} \mid \mathbf{x}) \) to help improve the
reconstruction.</p>

<h3 id="a-concrete-example">A concrete example</h3>

<p>Let the prior distribution on \( \mathbf{z} \) be an isotropic gaussian:</p>

<p>\[
    p_\theta(\mathbf{z}) = \prod_{i=1}^N \mathcal{N}(z_i \mid 0, 1)
\]</p>

<p>and let the approximate posterior distributions be normal and factorized:</p>

<p>\[
    q_\phi(\mathbf{z} \mid \mathbf{x}) =
    \prod_{i=1}^N \mathcal{N}(z_i \mid \mu_i(\mathbf{x}),
                                            \sigma_i^2(\mathbf{x}))
\]</p>

<p>Then the KL-divergence term integrates to</p>

<p>\[
    D_{KL} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N
              1 + \log(\sigma_i^2(\mathbf{x})) - \mu_i^2(\mathbf{x}) -
              \sigma_i^2(\mathbf{x}) 
\]</p>

<p>Once again, a complete derivation of this result can be found in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114">(Kingma and Welling, 2014)</a>.</p>

<p>Note that the functional form of parameters in \( \theta \) and \( \phi \)
has not been specified yet. This means the encoding and decoding networks
that output parameters can have any differentiable form you’d like.</p>

<h3 id="demo-model">Demo model</h3>

<p>The model trained for this demonstration is exactly like the model described in
the previous section and has the following properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>400-dimensional latent space</li>
  <li>Encoding network has two hidden layers with 2000 rectified linear units each</li>
  <li>Decoding network has two hidden layers with 2000 rectified linear units each</li>
  <li>Isotropic gaussian prior distribution:
\[
    p(\mathbf{z}) = \prod_{i} \mathcal{N}(z_i \mid 0, 1)
\]</li>
  <li>Isotropic gaussian approximate posterior distribution:
\[
    q(\mathbf{z} \mid \mathbf{x}) = \prod_{i}
        \mathcal{N}(z_i \mid \mu(\mathbf{x}), \sigma^2(\mathbf{x}))
\]</li>
  <li>Isotropic gaussian conditional distribution:
\[
