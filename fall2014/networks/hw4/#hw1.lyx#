Since you're not waiting for the frames to go all the way around the token-ring
 there's only 1 propagation time incurred for the token, i.e.

 & \approx\frac{n\cdot E\left(T\right)}{n\cdot E\left(T\right)+Prop}\\
 & \approx\frac{n\cdot E\left(T\right)}{n\cdot E\left(T\right)}\frac{1}{1+\frac{Prop}{n\cdot E\left(T\right)}}\\

For release after transmission the utilization obviously goes up as the
 number of nodes 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 increases, since the 
\begin_inset Formula $a/n\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 increases.
 For the release after reception the utilization does not change as a function
 of number of nodes.
 For Ethernet the constant coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $5$
\end_inset

 increases because propagation delay increased as the number of collisions
 increase, which is a function of the number of nodes.

Supposing that propagation delay,

We can either change 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{prop}$

 If we decrease

 by a factor of 10 of the original 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{prop_{1}}$

then
\begin_inset Formula

No I don't agree.
 Since token propagation time will increase only negligibly then in either

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

release after reception

, the times between receipt and release of the the token will be the same.
 Hence, assuming that all nodes are attempting to transmit at all times
 and only kept from transmitting by a lack of token, they will all be able
 to transmit at the same rate, regardless of how many are on the network.

\begin_layout Enumerate
Switches allow multiple simultaneous transmissions and the switch does selective
 forwarding, instead of simply broadcast and filtration.
 Each host has a dedicated direct connection to the switch, the switch buffers
 packets sent by hosts, and then retransmits based on a correspondence between
 MAC address of recipient and interface that that recipient is connected
 to.
 Initially this correspondence is not established and so the first time
 a switch receives a packet for a host on unknown link it floods all the
 links and waits for a response from the host.
 From then on it only sends across that link and so there are no collisions
 - each link is its own collision domain links are full-duplex so no collisions
 occur.
 Therefore simultaneous transmission from all hosts is possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
CSMA/CD is not need in current implementations of Switched Ethernet because
 every host is on its own collision domain.
 It is still supported for backwards compatibility and for half-duplex connectio
ns, where the switch needs to know when the host is sending so that its
 responses don't collide with the host's transmissions.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
No it is difficult to sense collisions when transmitting due to weak/fading
 received signals.
 Furthermore you can't in general sense all collisions of hidden nodes,
 discussed below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The hidden terminal problem is when, for example, 3 nodes A,B,C are communicatin
g and node B can sense both A and C but neither A can sense C nor C sense
 A.
 And so collision detection becomes impossible since C can be transmitting
 to B and yet to A it appears as if no one is transmitting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The way that 802.11 works is that it first senses for an amount of time equal
 to DIFS, distributed inter-frame spacing.
 If the channel is clear then it transmits the entire frame.
 But if the channel is not clear, if the protocol senses that the channel
 is busy, then a random timer is started,which sets the amount of time the
 protocol will wait until trying to transmit.
 Since the timer is completely random it does not give preferential treatment
 to those who have gotten some data sent already.
 Alternatively you could have a situation where a node that is sending a
 large number of frames hogs the link because each time the timers of the
 users expire the channel is still busy but when the exploitative node finishes
 sending a frame all of other nodes still have timers running.
 This is an instance where priorities would be necessary, or where the DIFS
 helps the fairness.

Rate adaption is the selection of the appropriate encoding scheme in order
 to match the prevailing signal to noise ratio.
 That is to say that as the signal to noise ratio decreases it behooves
 the protocol to select a lower and lower encoding/transmission rate in
 order to space out the data, in order to reduce the bit error rate, so
 that the receiver has more time to detect it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Since TCP depends on round trip time estimates in order to gauge the congestion
 in the network it will not respond appropriately at time when the encoding
 rates on wifi are switched (because this will appear to be congestion but
 in fact will simply be lower signal to noise ratio).

If you have the right signal to correlate with, the pseudo-noise signal,
 then you can decode the signal and if you don't have such a signal you
 will interpret just noise.
 This is useful for security since it effectively encrypts the signal.

ATM chops up TCP/IP datagrams into many much smaller cells.
 When one ATM cell is dropped, due to congestion, all other ATM cells that
 belong to the same IP datagram are uselessly being sent across the network.
 This is because the datagram isn't reassembled until it gets to the end
 of the route and only then does TCP check for corruption.
 Also one IP flow could branch into many ATM virtual circuits per single
 IP datagram, since IP packets are statistically switched and don't stay
 together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Solution: a discard strategy such that when a cell is discarded you minimize
 the transmission of other useless cells (potentially those from the same
 datagram).
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Partial Packet Discard: The ATM header identifies the end of a datagram
 by setting the type bit to 1.
 So a sequence of cells with type bits 000001 indicate that all those cells
 belong to the same datagram.
 When a cell is dropped at a switch, all cells belonging to the same datagram
 are dropped as well.
 On average this leads to only 1/2 of the cells of a datagram being transmitted
 uselessly because on average you'll be half way between the end of and
 beginning of the datagram when you decide to drop the rest of its cells.
 The only other problem is when ATM flows are mixed and then ATM header
 type bits might be 0101010 and it's unclear which cells belong to which
 datagram.
 So it's important to stratify distinct flows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Early Packet Discard: Monitor queues and preemptively drop all cells associated
 with a datagram when queue length exceeds some threshold.
 The problem with this is that fairness.
 The shorter the datagram the more likely it is to be dropped because the
 algorithm simply scans through the queue and looks for the next ATM header
 with type bit set to 1, indicating the end of a datagram, and drops that
 one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Fair buffer allocation: Use Early Packet Discard but drop packets from those
 flows using more than their fair sure of the queues, according to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
w\left(i\right)=\frac{n\left(i\right)}{n/v}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $n/v$
\end_inset

 is the number of queue slots occupied per flows and 
\begin_inset Formula $n\left(i\right)$
\end_inset

 is the number occupied by the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

th flow.
 Hence drop datagrams from the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

th connection if 
\begin_inset Formula $n>R$
\end_inset

, some congestion threshold, and 
\begin_inset Formula $w\left(i\right)>1$
\end_inset

.
 The downside is that the switch has to keep track of number of flows, total
 occupancy, and occupancy per connection, which doesn't scale.
 The solution is to aggregate flows.

AAL5 divides datagrams into cells and then reassembles these cells into
 original datagram at the receiving host and does a CRC check.
 The setting of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

PAYLOAD TYPE
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 mentioned in part (b) to work.
 This is called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

convergence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 AAL5 also does virtual circuit multiplexing which, by reducing number of
 cells needed to protocol data units, can increase efficiency.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If convergence wasn't available as a service in AAL5 then neither PPD nor
 EPD could be implemented since it would be impossible to distinguish one
 datagram from another.
 Then cells would be dropped randomly and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

useless cells being transmitted
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would be insoluble.
 If CRC were not offered it would bit error rates would be much higher and
 re-transmission would happen much more often.

Mobile IP attempts to provide support for host mobility while maintaining
 transparency.
 The point is so that the correspondent node doesn't need to know the location
 of the mobile node and that the connection already established should maintaine
d during movement.
 It solves the problem using registration with home agent, indirect routing
 of datagrams, agent discovery.
 When a mobile node moves to a foreign network it obtains a care-of-address
 from the foreign agent and registers it with its home agent.
 Then the care-of-address is used by the home agent to forward packets to
 the mobile node via the foreign agent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The main problem is the problem inherent in triangle routing, namely that
 going through the foreign agent might be a longer route than going through
 a direct route.
 Furthermore it incurs lots of traffic through the home agent with every
 move hence not fit for small moves, and there are hand-off delays.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To solve the triangular routing problem use route optimization to perform
 a binding update to bind new address to correspondent node after the first
 time the mobile node gets packets from it, so that the packets don't have
 to go through the home agent from then on.
 The correspondent also changes the destination address the packets to go
 to mobile node's new address.
 To solve the micromobility problem use the hierarchical approach: during
 frequent movement only local hand-off is performed, without changing the
 home agent or the correspondent node.

This spectral congestion problem is resolved, high capacity is achieved,
 by replacing a single high power base stations with many smaller, lower
 power base stations, and limiting the coverage of the base station to a
 localized region, a cell.
 Each smaller base stations is allocated a number of channels and then the
 same channels are reused in other cells.

Frequency-planning/channel-allocation is another problem.
 It is the problem of how to allocate in the most efficient way the spectra
 to each cluster, considering that sometimes there are shifting demands
 on the clusters.
 That is to say that sometimes one cluster will have very little demand
 placed on it while others have much demand and spectra should be allocated
 proportionally.

Sure.
 Why not? For applications where there isn't one particular source and many
 sinks (like streaming television) and just regular point to point communication
 a unicast protocol like TCP is best.
 With multicast any transmissions will be rate capped to the lowest common
 denominator (rate control algorithm in order to sync) but with unicast
 transmitters will abide by the TCP congestion control algorithms and transmit
 at peak possible throughput (subject to packet loss from interference and
 fading).
