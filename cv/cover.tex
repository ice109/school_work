Dear Sir or Madam:\\[1em]
%

I'm a mathematically minded engineer with almost three years of academic experience in machine learning (ML), data analysis, and back-end development. I graduated from University of Florida (UF) with a Master of Science in Computer Science in the Fall of 2015. Since then I've continued to work under my MS adviser but I'm now transitioning from academia to industry. I'd love to bring my expertise and enthusiasm to your growing development team. %I'm interested particularly in [blank] because of [blank]. 

\vskip 1em

At UF, funded by an Army Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) grant, I worked on a ~300KLOC MATLAB codebase. The system is a ML pipeline framework (prescreening, featurization, discrimination, and scoring) called the \emph{Testing Unified Framework} (TUF), with modules written by researchers, for landmine detection using various sensor platforms deployed in Iraq, Afghanistan, and civilian areas (Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam). I was the sole developer tasked with extending its functionality by implementing a true RDBMS data back-end. The first iteration I wrote was a SQLite interface in Java (including schema), with MATLAB interop. After project goals changed (as they're wont to do) I replaced SQLite with Postgres. It was further decided that prior to bringing a new service online (Postgres) it was necessary to migrate all of the DevOps services (Redmine for project management, LDAP for authentication, Rhodecode for VCS) provided by the lab from a monolothic, aging, single Ubuntu 10 server to a KVM container system. For this project I was lead with another student under me. We did all of this as well, including rolling backups for the VMs and web front-ends for the various services (Flask and Apache).

\vskip 1em

Suffice it so say I'm equally as comfortable working independently on large projects involving new technology, as I am collaborating on a team.

\vskip 1em

Throughout the course of the project I had deliverables (quarterly reports to NVESD) and had to liase with civilian Army personnel and researchers in far flung groups. Furthermore I always abided by self-imposed timelines in order to efficiently allocate time to studies and work, and maintain non-technical objectivity with respect to what we were materially providing for our grantors. 

\vskip 1em

I'm interested in interviewing at your earliest convenience.
