\section{Work experience}

\cventry{2014--present}{Research Assistant}{University of
  Florida}{Gainesville, FL}{}{I coordinate and develop the infrastructure for the TUF (Testing Unified Framework) system in the Computational Science and Intelligence Lab. I designed and implemented a Postgres Database backend for TUF, including a Java-MATLAB interface layer, and ported legacy database functionality (glorified hash table) to make use thereof. I also upgraded and migrated backend services, running on an obsolescent Ubuntu 10.04 server, to a robust, containered (VMs) system.  }

\cventry{2011--2013}{Education Peace Corps Volunteer}{PCUganda}{Mbale, Uganda}{}{Taught Physics and Mathematics at the O-level and A-level, equivalent to 11-12th grade and college freshmen. Also taught MS Office and Excel to students in ICT (information and communications technology) classes. Maintained and repaired computers 
and equipment in the WorldBank donated computer lab. Connected local intranet to WorldBank donated on-campus Wifi hotspot by means of a Linksys Tomato flashed router.  Trained teachers in computer use, Excel and Office and proprietary lab software, in order to help them incorporate computers into their lesson planning and course design. Designed experiments and learning aids for GirlTech, a summer camp for rural school girls. Specifically a demonstration of a Ruben's tube and water propulsion rockets. General IT and audio/visual (soundboard, projector, PA) maintenance during camp.}

\cventry{2010}{Research Assistant}{High Performance Materials Institute}{Tallahssee, FL}{}{LABview programming to facilitate operation of laboratory equipment detailed below (AFM, Scanning electron microscope, gold evaporator). AFM (atomic force microscopy) to perform interface conduction measurements of carbon nanotubes. Acid doping experiments on single-walled nanotubes. Evaporative coating (by gold) of silicone substrate. Weekly presentations/lectures on progress of experiments.}

\cventry{2009}{Research Assistant}{Center for Advanced Power Systems}{Tallahassee, FL}{}{Compiled data on dielectrics for capacitors in order to facilitate discharge experiments. RGA (residual gas analysis) for characterization of various dielectrics and further modeling in MATLAB of polarization curves. Boil-off calirometry testing on super-conducting cuprates.}

%\cventry{2006--2007}{Postdoctoral Fellow}{ITCEP, University of
%  Minnesota}{}{}{Taught honors calculus and linear algebra courses for
%  UMTYMP, a program for advanced high school students, as well as linear
%  algebra and differential equations for engineering students. Co-taught
%  summer sessions on mathematics for elementary school teachers.
